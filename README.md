# Self_Assessment_final

## Self-Assessment

At first, I took the role of presentation and responsible for github, and then I switched to work on the dashboard because I think visualize the data is an important and fun part of the project. I also look out to my teammates and help them out of the machine learning code and the ETL process. Actually, I barely used Slack before, but by this project, I found it is very useful way to contact with my teammates. We discuss a lot and were able to show how we were dealing with the coding. After all, It took me total 2 weeks to learn again the Tableau functions which I learned in the module several weeks ago, and I found it is actually very easy to use, and provide amazing visualization that a web application will ever need. I also overcome the internet distance between my teammates and were able to communicate much more than I've written in the communication plan, it was almost every day. 

## Team Assessment

My team were pretty balance, where each person is all about their field and we were able to collaborate and contribute our works to the project. Vick is responsible for mostly database, Archana stayed overnight for the machine learning model and Frances was an artist with her amazing presentation. We wrote on the plan that we should meet 2 times a week, but actually, we almost stayed with each other everytime. Every morning I woke up, it's all slack messages and especially in this pandemic time, it is an amazing feeling that motivates me to keep working on this project. The challenge that I think we were suffer about was the machine learning model, where we obtained a negative number at first, but later on, we keep working, googling, and asked our TAs about their idea and raised them a little by little. Our strength as a team is that we are pretty balance, so after we've done our job for the week, we can seek out to our teammates to ask if they need help. The tip I want to share is that Google is your biggest assistant where you can look up so many sample on there, and they helped a lot in order to improve our final results.



## Summary of Project 

I've been working on a machine learning projected that called "Sales Prediction for Walmart". It used time series forecasting for supervised machine learning. In there, we were able to apply linear regression and obtain a results of 48% which is considered ok for a historical data set from 2012. We are still improving its result everyday.
